## About

This app showcases example games built using the Zylem framework. Currently, the framework is private, but it will be made public soon. It aims to be a more functional successor to the Pyramid Game Lib framework.

## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
pnpm install
```
